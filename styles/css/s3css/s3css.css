Welcome and thank you for using S3CSS (pronounced as 'streaks'), a lightweight CSS/JS
open source framework (coded in CSS and jQuery) to help you create simple, responsive website templates.
It was developed by J. Djimitry Riviere in 2016, and continues to be improved upon by its
developer. The major key to this framework lies within its ease of us to deliver superb results
when creating a website. Not only that, it is and will always remain FREE to use; though in
exchange, providing feedback and help find ways to improve the framework further would be
appreciated.

Thank you for using S3CSS! Happy Designing!

            framework functions.
